Image processing is a technique that is used to either enhance the quality of the image
or extract useful information from it.

An image is nothing but a two dimensional array i.e any image can be represented using a 
2D array.


Applications of Image Processing:
    Image processing in todays advancing world have various uses such as;
    
    Intelligent transportation systems
    Moving object Tracking
    Defence
    Automatic Visual Inspection system and so on.
    
    
    
    
On Scikit-image:


The scikit-image provides a verstile set of image processing routines.
It works with Numpy arrays.
Within scikit-image, images are represented as NumPy arrays
The package can be imported as 

>> import skimage
